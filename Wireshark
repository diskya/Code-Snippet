How to list all the DNS domains?
Queries: assets.msn.com: type A, class IN
how to get all the domains of all queries as a list?

This is a classic case for using tshark with the -T fields option. With a display filter set so that only answers are shown:
tshark -r <yourcapture> -Y "dns.count.answers > 0" -T fields -e dns.qry.name -e dns.resp.name
replacing <yourcapture> with the path to the capture file.

Output looks like this, with first the query, then the answer(s):
az667904.vo.msecnd.net  az667904.vo.msecnd.net,az667904-pme.azureedge.net,az667904-pme.ec.azureedge.net,cs9.wpc.v0cdn.net
Note in this case there were multiple answer records for the query, all comma separated.
